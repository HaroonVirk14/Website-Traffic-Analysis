# Website Traffic Analysis
Excited to share my latest data analysis journey using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn! 🐍 Here’s a comprehensive overview of what I’ve uncovered from a dataset tracking daily website visitors:

Data Cleansing and Preparation:
🧹 Cleaned and formatted data for accurate analysis.
📅 Extracted year and month from dates to analyze trends over time.

Visualizing Trends:
📈 Plotted monthly trends of unique visits by year, showcasing fluctuations and patterns using Seaborn.
🎨 Visualized the distribution of unique visits with a histogram, providing insights into visit frequency.

Understanding Cumulative Metrics:
📆 Calculated cumulative metrics such as unique visits, first-time visits, and returning visits over time.
📊 Visualized these cumulative trends using Matplotlib, illustrating growth and engagement evolution.

Behavioral Analysis:
🔄 Explored the ratio of returning to first-time visits, highlighting user engagement dynamics.
📉 Monitored changes in visitor behavior over time to inform strategic decisions.

This analysis not only deepened my understanding of web traffic patterns but also provided actionable insights for enhancing user experience and engagement.
